PAMPHLET, &amp;c.</h2>


<p class="newsection"><span class="smcap"><span class="dropcap">A</span>&nbsp;Publication</span> having lately
been made by the Rev. Mr.
<i>Maskelyne</i> Astronomer Royal, under
the Authority of the Board
of Longitude, manifestly tending,
by the Suppression of some Facts and the
Misrepresentation of others, to impress the
World with an unjust Opinion of my Invention,
and falsely asserting that my Watch
did not at certain Periods therein mentioned
keep Time with sufficient Exactness
to determine the Longitude within the Limits
prescribed by the Act of the 12th of
Queen <i>Anne</i>; I think it incumbent upon me
to submit some Observations thereon to the
impartial Publick; and the rather, because
the said Pamphlet is rendered so confused by
unnecessary Repetitions, and voluminous
Tables, that a Man must be pretty conversant
in these Matters, to trace and combine
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">[2]</a></span>the Facts, so as to check the Conclusions,
which would consequently be taken upon
Trust by the generality of Readers, unless
publickly contradicted. As it will be my
Endeavour so far to avoid the Use of all
Terms of Art as to make the Subject generally
intelligible, I flatter myself I shall not
be thought impertinent for giving a short
Explanation (though quite unnecessary to
the far greater Part of my Readers) of what
the Longitude is, and what the Service required
of the Watch.</p>

<p>The Longitude of any Place is its Distance
East or West from any other given
Place; and what we want is a Method of
finding out at Sea, how far we are got to the
Eastward or Westward of the place we sailed
from. The Application of a Time-Keeper
to this Discovery is founded upon the following
Principles: The Earth’s Surface is
divided into 360 equal Parts (by imaginary
Lines drawn from North to South) which are
called Degrees of Longitude; and it’s daily
Revolution Eastward round it’s own Axis is
performed in 24 Hours; consequently in
that Period, each of those imaginary Lines or
Degrees, becomes successively opposite to the
Sun (which makes the Noon or precise Middle
of the Day at each of those Degrees); and
it must follow, that from the Time any one
of those Lines passes the Sun, till the next
passes, must be just four Minutes, for 24
Hours being divided by 360 will give that
Quantity; so that for every Degree of Longitude
we sail Westward, it will be Noon
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">[3]</a></span>with us four Minutes the later, and for every
Degree Eastward four Minutes the sooner,
and so in Proportion for any greater or less
Quantity. Now, the exact Time of the Day
at the Place where we are, can be ascertained
by well known and easy Observations of
the Sun if visible for a few Minutes at any
Time from his being ten Degrees high ’till
within an Hour of Noon, or from an Hour
after Noon ’till he is only 10 Degrees high
in the Afternoon; if therefore, at any Time
when such Observation is made, a Time-Keeper
tells us at the same Moment what
o’Clock it is at the Place we sailed from,
our Longitude is clearly discovered. To
do this, it is not necessary that a Watch should
perform it’s Revolutions precisely in that
Space of time which the Earth takes to perform
her’s; it is only required that it should
invariably perform it in <i>some known Time</i>,
and then the constant Difference between
the Length of the one Revolution and the
other, will appear as so much daily gained
or lost by the Watch, which constant Gain
or Loss, is called <i>the Rate of its going</i>, and
which being added to or deducted from
the Time shewn by the Watch, will give the
true Time, and consequently the Difference
of Longitude.</p>

<p>I shall now proceed to make such Remarks
as occur to me on Perusal of Mr.
<i>Maskelyne</i>’s Pamphlet.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i> begins by telling us that the
Board of Longitude, at their Meeting, <i>April</i>
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_4" id="Page_4">[4]</a></span>26, 1766, came to a Resolution that my
Watch should be tried at the Royal Observatory
under his Inspection, and that he accordingly
received it on the 5th of <i>May</i>,
1766. He then says, “I most Days wound
up and compared the Watch with the
transit Clock of the Royal Observatory
myself; at other times it was performed
by my Assistant <i>Joseph Dymond</i>, and afterwards
<i>William Baily</i>; this was always done
in the Presence of, and attested by one of
the Officers of <i>Greenwich</i> Hospital, when
he came to assist in unlocking the
Box in which the Watch is kept, in
order to its being wound up.”</p>

<p>Not one of those Attestations appears in
the Book: Perhaps Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i> thinks
his Assertion of the Fact will be sufficient for
the Publick, and indeed so it might have
been to me, had I not received different Information:
But the Truth is, the Commissioners
appointed a Set of Gentlemen to attend
by Rotation the winding up of the
Watch; they were to unlock the Box the
Watch was in, to see it wound up and compared
with the Clock, then to lock the Box
again and take the Key with them, and Mr.
<i>Maskelyne</i> was to have another Key, there
being two Locks to the Box:<a name="FNanchor_1_1" id="FNanchor_1_1"></a><a href="#Footnote_1_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a> The Officers
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">[5]</a></span>of <i>Greenwich</i> Hospital were appointed
for this Service, some of whom from the
Infirmities of Age, and Misfortunes in the
Service, were scarce able to get up the Hill
to the Observatory, so that when they
came there, as can be proved from undoubted
Eye Witnesses, they only unlocked the Box,
sate down ’till Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i> had done what
he thought proper, and then locked the Box
again, and departed: and whatever Attestation
they may be supposed to have made,
I can prove that at several Times when
Gentlemen of my Acquaintance happened
to be present, the Attendance of the Officers
was by no Means an effectual Check
upon the Comparison of the Watch with
the Clock. I would not be thought to accuse
those Gentlemen of Neglect of the Duty
imposed upon them; on the contrary I applaud
their Diligence in being ready at all
Hours of the Day to attend when Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i>
was pleased to appoint; and therefore
I will even for the present (though contrary
to Fact) suppose they have been the Check
proposed by the Commissioners of Longitude
against any unfair Access <i>to the Watch</i>, still
<i>the Clock</i> with which it was compared <i>was
left entirely in</i> Mr. Maskelyne<i>’s Power</i>, and
an Alteration of the one could not but produce
just the same Effect as an Error of the
other, nor is there even the least <i>Pretence of
a Check</i> either on the Clock, or on its
Comparison with Observations of the Sun;
nay on the contrary, Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i> did
at this Time take the Key of the Clock from
Mr. <i>Dymond</i> in whose Custody it used to be,
and kept it himself.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_6" id="Page_6">[6]</a></span>Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i> then proceeds to give us
an Account of the Watch’s going from Day
to Day, which in his 15th Page he concludes
thus: “From the foregoing Numbers
it appears, that the Watch was getting
from the very first near 20 seconds
per day; a circumstance which is not
my business to account for; but which,
as it kept near mean Time in the Voyage
to Barbadoes, seems to shew that the
Watch cannot be taken to pieces and put
together again without altering its Rate
of going considerably, contrary to Mr.
<i>Harrison</i>’s Assertions formerly.”</p>

<p>When I made the Discovery, upon Oath,
of the Principles and Construction of the
Watch, to six Gentlemen appointed by the
Board of Longitude and to Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i>,
(who insisted on having a Right to attend, as
being a Commissioner) which Discovery was
finished on the 22d Day of <i>August</i>, 1765, as
appears by the annex’d Certificate,<a name="FNanchor_2_2" id="FNanchor_2_2"></a><a href="#Footnote_2_2" class="fnanchor">[2]</a> the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_7" id="Page_7">[7]</a></span>Watch then remained in my Hands, all
taken to pieces: I little imagined the Board
of Longitude would take it from me, as not
conceiving any Use they could make of it; and
having besides received Assurances from them,
that they only wanted the formal Delivery of
it, in compliance with the Terms of the new
Law, without meaning to deprive me of the
Use of it: I therefore went on making some
experiments, and alter’d the Rate of its going,
thereby to determine a Fact I wanted
to be satisfied about. The Watch was under
this Experiment the latter End of <i>October</i>,
1765, when upon receiving the Certificate
for the Remainder of the first Moiety of my
Reward, I was ordered to deliver it to the
Board. My Son, attending with it, being
asked if it was then as fit as before to ascertain
the Longitude, reply’d in the Affirmative;
for as I have before shewn, the <i>Rate of its
going</i>, when once ascertained, does not prevent
its keeping the Longitude. He was
not asked the present Rate of its going, nor
could he have answer’d with precision if he
had, because we had not had Notice sufficient
to determine that Point; but we
did, at that Time, tell several of our
Friends that it went about 18 or 19 Seconds
a Day, <i>fast</i>, and we have at several Times
since (without ever dreaming that this was to
become a Point of public Discussion) had
Occasion to mention the same Thing to several
Members of Parliament, Commissioners
of Longitude and other Gentlemen, insomuch
that we did not believe any body was
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_8" id="Page_8">[8]</a></span>uninformed of it, who at all attended to the
Business of the Longitude.</p>

<p>This may serve to account for the Circumstance
which Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i> declares, <i>it
was none of his Business to account for</i>, why the
Watch was getting near 20 Seconds per Day;
but as to <i>his Inference</i>, I must say it betrays
the most absolute Ignorance of Mechanics,
and of this Machine in particular, in which it
is obvious (and for this Fact I appeal to the
Watchmakers who saw it taken to Pieces)
that its going at the same Rate when put together
again, as before, depends (if none of
the Parts are alter’d) upon nothing more
complicated <i>than putting a single Screw into
the same Place from whence it was taken</i>.
Indeed this Passage, and the ignorant and
puerile Remarks which Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i> has
been suffer’d to prefix to my written Description
of the Watch (to the Disgrace of this
Country in those foreign Translations it has
already undergone) bring strongly to my
Remembrance an Observation made by
some of the Gentlemen present at the Discovery,
“that they wonder’d at his Patience
in attending so long to a Subject he seem’d
so totally unacquainted with.”</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i> then proceeds to tell us of a
Change that happen’d in the going of the
Watch, and says, “this Change began in
the Beginning of <i>August</i>, on the few and
only hot Days we had last Summer,
which yet were not extreme, the Thermometer
within Doors having never risen
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_9" id="Page_9">[9]</a></span>above 73°. The Rest of the Summer in
general was remarkably cool and temperate.”
When I took this Watch to Pieces
I informed Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i> and the other
Gentlemen, that in trying any Experiments
with it, in Respect to Heat and Cold, it
would be proper that it should be so fixed
that, as far as could be, the Heat should
have an equal Influence on all Sides of it;
and it is obvious that the Thermometer
ought to have been kept in the same Box
with it; but as this was not done, I apprehend
the Effects of Heat mention’d above
do not merit much Attention; and therefore
shall only observe that the Watch was placed
in a Box with a Glass in the Lid and another
in one Side, in the Seat of a Window
level with the lowest Pane of the Window,
and exposed to the South East, whilst the
Thermometer, which was to ascertain the
Degree of Heat the Watch was exposed to,
was placed in a shady Part of the Room:
Now ’tis obvious that while the Air surrounding
the Thermometer might be very
temperate, there might, if the Sun shone
upon it, be a heat in the Box, superior
to what was ever felt in the open Air in
any Part of the World; and perhaps greater
than any human being could subsist in, and
consequently improper, or at least unnecessary
for this experiment.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i> next tells us of an irregularity
which he says happened in cold Weather,
and says, “However, it seems in general
that the Frost must have been the
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_10" id="Page_10">[10]</a></span>cause of these irregularities, as well as
of the Watch’s going so much slower in
the Month of <i>January</i>, than it had gone
before.” Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i> ought along
with this, to have published what I told
him when I explained it; that the Provision
against the effects of Heat and Cold was
not <i>in this Machine</i> extended to all Degrees;
that I never had tryed it so low as
the freezing Point, which according to the
best Informations I have been able to procure
is a Degree of Cold <i>that never did exist
between the Decks of a Ship at Sea</i>, in any Climate
yet explored by Mankind.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i> then comes to the Rate
of its going in different Positions; and says,
“It is obvious, these last-mentioned Trials
of the Watch in a vertical Position could
not be designed to shew how near it would
go at Sea, where it can never obtain these
Positions: the Intent of them is to prove
how near Mr. <i>Harrison</i>’s Execution of
his Watch comes up to his Principles,
with respect to the making all the Arcs
described by the balance, whether large
or small, to be performed in the same
Time, as Mr. <i>Harrison</i> asserts them to
be.” Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i> here also might have
had Candour enough to inform the Public,
as I did him, that although the Watch was
quite sufficient to answer the Purposes required
of it in Navigation, and to fulfil
what was prescribed by the Act of Queen
<i>Anne</i>, yet it was far from being in a state of
Perfection, <i>as an universal exact Time-Keeper
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_11" id="Page_11">[11]</a></span>for every Purpose</i>: I shew’d him and the rest
of the Gentlemen the Reasons why the Machine
then before them, would not go at the
same Rate in such different Positions <i>into which
the Motion of a Ship could never put it</i>; and
whilst I explained to them those Imperfections
in the particular Machine we were
examining, I also in the clearest Manner I
was able, pointed out the means of remedying
them with certainty in others, which
the Gentlemen skill’d in Mechanics seem’d
perfectly to comprehend, and to be satisfied
of the Truth which I again assert,
that Watches made on my Principles will
endure a much greater Motion and change
of Position than they can ever be subject
to in a Ship; and that they will not be affected
by any Degree of Heat or Cold, in
which a Man can live.</p>

<p>If any Thing was meant to be concluded
with respect to me by this Experiment, either
in Point of Property or of Reputation,
common Justice would have required that
I should have had an Opportunity of seeing
the Facts ascertained; and when such a
Trial was directed as put the Result in the
absolute Power of a single Person, that I
should have been satisfied of his Integrity,
Disinterestedness and Ability for the purpose.
I would not be understood to attack Mr.
<i>Maskelyne</i>’s Knowledge of the Theory of Astronomy;
as for any Thing I know to the contrary,
it may be of the very first Rate, especially
as the Commissioners have thought proper
to entrust him with the Execution of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_12" id="Page_12">[12]</a></span>their commands; and which he has ever
been as ready to undertake: But alas! as to
his skill in Mechanics, he knows little or nothing
of the matter he has ventur’d to take
in Hand.</p>

<p>I think it more consistent with the respect
I owe to the Public, and myself, to speak
out plainly, than to have recourse to <i>Insinuations</i>,
on a Subject of this nature:
I therefore declare, that I am not satisfied
with the Truth of his reporting other Observations
relative to the Longitude, as I do
maintain that in both his Voyages the Observations
which he said he made the Land by,
were not calculated till after he had seen the
Land; and I am certain those he has given,
in the Publication now before us, are not
genuine, for he pretends to find each Observation
of the Transit of the Sun to the
hundredth part of a Second of Time,&mdash;a
Degree of exactness about twenty Times
beyond what any other Observer has hitherto
found practicable: Moreover I know
him to be deeply interested in the Lunar
Tables, a Scheme set up some Years ago
for the Reward in Competition with my
Invention, and for which large Sums of
Money have already been paid by the
Public.</p>

<p>Although I flatter myself the Reader is
already in Possession of very sufficient Reasons
for rejecting the whole Pamphlet as
partial and inconclusive, yet I entreat his
patient Attention whilst I advance one step
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_13" id="Page_13">[13]</a></span>farther, and shew, that although Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i>
has presented us with a set of Observations
which <i>according to his mode of Calculation</i>,
prove what he advances, yet those
very Observations when rightly reasoned
upon <i>prove the contrary</i>; and that in each of
the Periods he refers to, except those of the
severe Frost and improper Positions (against
which Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i> ought to have informed
the World I never warranted this particular
Watch) it kept Time with sufficient correctness
to determine the Longitude within
the limits of the Act of Queen <i>Anne</i>.</p>

<p>The Reader by this Time knows enough
of the Subject to see, that in order to try
whether the Watch would or would not keep
Time with sufficient Exactness to determine
the Longitude, Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i>’s first Operation,
after receiving it, should have been to
ascertain <i>the Rate of its going</i>. But no such
Thing happened: he knew it had not gone
exactly correspondent to mean Time, during
the Voyage to <i>Barbadoes</i>; it had been
publickly enough declared that its Rate of
going had been since altered; and, if he had
not received that Information, he might nay
must have discovered it in the first 24 Hours
Tryal; however, without once attending to
this <i>essential Circumstance</i>, he goes to work,
comparing the first Period of six Weeks
(which he observes is generally reckoned the
Term of a West-India Voyage) when it was
in an horizontal Position, with <i>mean Time</i>, instead
of <i>the corrected Time</i>, and each succeeding
Period with that immediately preceeding
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_14" id="Page_14">[14]</a></span>it! Who can hesitate in pronouncing
that his Conclusions must be all erroneous?
He should first have ascertained the Rate of
its going by a Length of Observations of the
Sun or Stars, or by a perfect Pendulum Clock
if he had such a one, and then have corrected
the Time shewn by the Watch accordingly.
However, supposing for a Moment
his <i>Facts</i> to be genuine, I will deduce the
<i>real Result</i> in the best Manner the Observations
will admit, rejecting those made while
the Watch was in improper Positions, and
those during the Frost, for the same Reasons
that Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i> lays no Stress upon them,
and for those I have already stated. I shall
therefore (pursuing his Idea of six Weeks)
take it during the first tranquil six Weeks
that it had, viz. from <i>July</i> the 6th, to <i>August</i>
the 17th, in which Time it gained in all 11
Minutes, 50 Seconds, or 16&nbsp;<span class="above">9</span>&#8260;<span class="below">10</span> Seconds per
Day which I will assume as the Rate of its
going, or if Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i> pleases I will
take the Average of his whole Time of Examination,
from the 6th of <i>July</i> to the 3d
of <i>January</i> and from the 9th of <i>January</i> to
the 4th of <i>March</i>, which will come out at the
Rate of 16&nbsp;<span class="above">8</span>&#8260;<span class="below">10</span> Seconds per Day fast, and I
say that according to either of those Rates
of going, the Watch kept the Longitude
within the Limits of the Act of Queen <i>Anne</i>,
during any Period of six Weeks that can be
pointed out, excepting those of extreme
Cold, and improper Position which have already
been explained. I do not trouble the
Reader with the Calculations: If I assert an
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_15" id="Page_15">[15]</a></span>Untruth, I shall hardly escape Contradiction.</p>

<p>There is another Inaccuracy, which tho’
of less Consequence, ought not to escape notice.
One would naturally suppose when
Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i> found the Watch went at this
Rate of gaining on Mean Time, he would
have been very exact in his Time of comparing
it with his Clock; but on the contrary
we find he was so irregular as to vary his
Comparisons on succeeding Days from half
an Hour to four Hours and 48 Minutes, and
this not for a Time or two, but for one
third of the whole Time he had it.</p>

<p>Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i> having shewn from the Result
of his Calculation (which I have here
proved to be false) that the Watch is not to
be depended upon to determine the Longitude
in a Voyage of six Weeks, then says,
“these Considerations are sufficient to explain
the Motives which might have actuated
Mr. <i>Harrison</i>, as a Man of Prudence,
in desiring to send his Watch two
Voyages to the West Indies, upon his
Idea that he should be intitled to the large
Rewards prescribed in the Act of the 12th
of Queen <i>Anne</i>, in Case his Watch kept
Time within the Limits there mentioned,
whether the Method itself was or could be
rendered generally useful and practicable,
or not;” this Insinuation <i>(published under
the Authority of the Commissioners of Longitude)</i>
that I had contrived a Trial which I knew
the Watch would fulfil, whilst I was conscious
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_16" id="Page_16">[16]</a></span>that it would not answer the general
Purposes of the Act of Queen <i>Anne</i>, and
consequently that I had formed a villainous
Scheme to rob the Publick of the Reward
without really and effectually performing
the Conditions, strikes me as a Charge of so
atrocious a Nature, that I think myself not
only <i>justified</i> in publishing to the World
what has been done with respect to Trials of
the Merit of my Invention, but even <i>indispensably
obliged</i> so to do. I well know
what I hazard thereby, and if the rest of
my Reward cannot be obtained on Principles
of <i>National Faith</i> and <i>Publick Spirit</i>, I
am contented to forego it, but I will not descend
into the Grave loaded with that Dishonour
which my Enemies, availing themselves
of their Rank or Offices, have, in various
Ways, attempted to throw upon me.</p>

<p>In the first Place I must remark, that the
Trial referred to was not fixed <i>by me</i>, but by
<i>an Act of Parliament</i> passed so long ago as
the Year 1714, which (after vesting certain
discretionary Powers in Commissioners to
judge what Methods are likely to prove
practicable, and authorizing them to issue
smaller Sums of Money) goes on to fix the
last grand Test of the Merit of any such Invention,
and enacts “that when a Ship, under
the Appointment of the said Commissioners,
shall thereby actually sail from <i>Great
Britain</i> to the <i>West Indies</i> without losing her
Longitude beyond certain Limits, the Inventor
shall be intitled to certain Rewards.”
Having from the Year 1726, employed myself
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_17" id="Page_17">[17]</a></span>in adapting those Principles which I had <i>at
that Time</i> executed in a Pendulum Clock, to
an Instrument or Time-Keeper so constructed
as to endure the Motion of a Ship at Sea,
and having made a Voyage to <i>Lisbon</i> and
done sundry other Things during a Course
of Years, mostly under the Direction of the
Commissioners of Longitude, by way of
preparatory Experiments, I thought the Invention
sufficiently perfect about the latter
End of the Year 1760, to go upon the ultimate
Trial, which I accordingly applied for.
My Son, after being sent to <i>Portsmouth</i>
with the third Time-keeper (the fourth
or Watch being to be sent to him) was
kept there five Months, waiting for
Orders; which having by returning to
<i>London</i> at Length obtained, he went to
<i>Jamaica</i> in the <i>Deptford</i> Man of War,
and returned in the <i>Merlin</i> Sloop of
War, having fulfilled every Instruction of
the Commissioners. It remained to compute
from the Astronomical Observations
made at <i>Portsmouth</i> and <i>Jamaica</i>, whether
the Watch had or had not kept the Longitude
within the prescribed Limits; and as
my Title to 20,000<i>l.</i> was to be determined
thereby, I thought it but reasonable that I
should name some Person to check the Computations,
<i>which was refused</i>. The Commissioners
appointed three Gentlemen for
that Purpose, and on receiving their Report
were pleased to declare <i>that the Watch had
not kept its Longitude within the above mentioned
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_18" id="Page_18">[18]</a></span>Limits</i>.<a name="FNanchor_3_3" id="FNanchor_3_3"></a><a href="#Footnote_3_3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> Thoroughly convinced of
the contrary (for I had the same Materials
they had to calculate from) I required a Copy
of the Computations <i>which was also refused
me</i>; nor could I ever obtain a Sight
of them either officially or through private
Favour, ’till three Years afterwards, when
they were ordered to be laid before the
House of Commons; and it then appeared
that two of the three Computations were absolutely
inconclusive, proving nothing, and the
third decided in my Favour. Further Proof
of the Watch having succeeded in this Voyage
may be found in the Journals of the
House of Commons, Vol. XXIX. P. 546, in
the Evidence of <i>George Lewis Scott</i> Esq; and
Mr. <i>James Short</i>.</p>

<p>The Reader will easily believe I did not
feel perfectly easy under this Treatment of
an Invention to the perfecting of which (encouraged
by the long continued Patronage
of a <i>Graham</i>, a <i>Halley</i>, a <i>Folkes</i>, &amp;c. &amp;c.&mdash;&mdash;learned
Friends to Society, and Publick
Good, whose Minds were too enlarged,
and Spirits too liberal to admit that <i>little</i>
Jealousy of inferior Artists, which since their
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_19" id="Page_19">[19]</a></span>Death I have been exposed to) I gloried in
sacrificing every Prospect of Advantage
from other Pursuits, and had willingly submitted
to lead a Life of Labour and Dependence.
However ’twas too late to retreat;
and I had only one Means of Success left
which was to follow the Commissioners in
their own Way. Accordingly after many
Difficulties (with a Relation of which I will
not tire the Reader, as it is by no Means
my Intention to meddle with any Subjects of
Complaint, except such as are material to
the forming a right Judgment of the Trials
made and proposed) a second Voyage to the
<i>West Indies</i> was agreed to in the latter End of
the Year 1762, which Agreement was afterwards
well nigh overset by the Commissioners
insisting on such Astronomical Observations
being previously made, as were
next to impracticable in this Climate, and
could be put into the Instructions for no
other Reason that I could conceive, but to
throw insuperable Difficulties in my Way,
as they were not at all material to the Determination
of the Matter in Question.
However the Commissioners at Length gave
up this Point on my Opinion of the Impracticability
being confirmed by that of an
Officer of the Navy distinguished for his
Abilities and Skill in Matters of Astronomy.
To take away all Possibility (as I thought)
of this Voyage being rendered fruitless like
the last, I then desired to have inserted at the
End of the Instructions some few Words to
this Purpose, “that provided the Experiment
answered, the Commissioners present were of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_20" id="Page_20">[20]</a></span>Opinion I should <i>without further Trouble</i>
receive my Reward;” but my Son
attending the Board with this Proposition
was told by Lord <i>Sandwich</i> at that Time
President, that it would be mere Tautology,
for that their giving Instructions implyed
the same Thing, and that if the Watch kept
its Time within the Limits of the Act there
could be no Doubt of my being entitled to
and receiving the Reward, and nobody
could take if from me. Upon the Faith of
this, my Son went the Voyage to <i>Barbadoes</i>,
in which the Watch kept its Time “considerably
within the nearest Limits of the
Act of Queen <i>Anne</i>,” as certified, even by
the Commissioners themselves.</p>

<p>On the Success of this Trial being known,
and after having employed near forty
Years of my Life on the Faith of
an Act of Parliament, was a Doctrine
broached to me (as I solemnly declare <i>for
the first Time</i>) that the Commissioners were
invested with a discretionary Power of ordering
other Trials and the fulfilling of
other Conditions than those specially annexed
by Act of Parliament to the Reward;<a name="FNanchor_4_4" id="FNanchor_4_4"></a><a href="#Footnote_4_4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a>
An Exposition of the Law, which I ever
did and ever shall (until it is supported by
legal Authority) totally reject and refuse
Obedience to; for I do maintain, that before
passing the last Act of Parliament I had
as full and perfect a <i>Right</i> to the Reward of
20,000<i>l.</i> as any Free-holder in <i>Britain</i> has to
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_21" id="Page_21">[21]</a></span>his Estate; and I never would have desired
nor ever will desire any better Satisfaction
than a judicial Determination of that Point;
which however it was very soon thought
proper to preclude me from, by a new Law,
passed at the Instance of the Commissioners
of Longitude, placing me <i>too certainly</i> under
the Discretion of the Commissioners and totally
changing the Terms on which the
Reward was to be given me, enacting that
I should have half of it when I had disclosed
the Principles and Construction of the Machine,
and assigned over for the Use of the
Publick the last made Timekeeper, together
with the three others which were not so perfect
as the last; and the other half when I
should have made more Watches, <i>without
determining how many</i>, and proved them to the
Satisfaction of the Commissioners, <i>without
defining the Mode of Trial</i>.</p>

<p>I frankly confess that from thenceforward
I considered the second Moiety of the Reward
as lost for ever. The first Moiety I obtained,
tho’ it was with great Difficulty, as the Act
required me to explain my Invention upon
Oath, and the Commissioners were pleased
to put into that Oath, Words of an indeterminate
and unlimited Meaning, and refused
to explain them, or even permit me or my
Son to ask what was meant by them. We at
length agreed to take it (finding we should
never get any Thing if we did not, such
was now the Power of the Commissioners)
and they declared that themselves and the
Gentlemen appointed by them to whom
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_22" id="Page_22">[22]</a></span>we were to explain it, would be <i>upon
Honour</i> not to disclose it, that I might
have an Opportunity of obtaining the
Reward promised by foreign Powers; however,
in less than a Month an Account
of it appeared in the public News-Papers,
signed by the Rev. Mr. <i>Ludlam</i>, one of the
six Gentlemen named by the Commissioners
to receive the Discovery, and therefore, I
make no doubt, by Leave of the Board.
Nor did they stop here, for they have
since published all my Drawings without
giving me the last Moiety of the Reward,
or even paying me and my Son for our
Time at the Rate of common Mechanicks;
a Discouragement to the Improvement of
Arts and Sciences, and an Instance of such
Cruelty and Injustice as I believe never existed
in a learned and civilized Nation before.</p>

<p>I have already had Occasion to mention,
that at the Time I receiv’d the Certificate
for the first Moiety of the Reward, the
Watch was delivered up; it remained six
Months locked up at the Admiralty, and
was then removed to Greenwich, to be the
Subject of those Experiments concerning
which I now trouble the Public. The other
three Machines, were (by Order of the
Commissioners) soon after demanded of me
by Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i>. One of them which had
been going more than thirty Years, was
broke to Pieces <i>under his careful and ingenious
management</i>, before it got out of my House;
and the other two were so far abused in the
Carriage by Land to <i>Greenwich</i>, as to be rendered
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_23" id="Page_23">[23]</a></span>quite incorrect, and as far as I can
learn, incapable of being repaired without
having some essential Parts made anew:
Thus perished the first Essays of this long-wished
for Invention!</p>

<p>Unwilling however that the Public should
lose the Benefit of the Discovery, or the
Chance of further Improvement, I applied,
by repeated Letters, to the Board, praying
that the Watch might be lent to me (offering
Security for it if required) for the Sake
of employing other Workmen to make the
different Parts by Model, with quicker Dispatch,
and in Order to determine by Experiments,
whether some expensive Parts of
the Machinery might not be abridged or
totally left out. Still have my Requests
been refused, and of late they have alledged
that they cannot keep their Engagements
with Mr. <i>Kendall</i> if they were to lend me
the Watch. What those Engagements are
may be seen below.<a name="FNanchor_5_5" id="FNanchor_5_5"></a><a href="#Footnote_5_5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> The new Act, as I
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_24" id="Page_24">[24]</a></span>have already observ’d, did not determine
<i>how many</i> more Watches were to be made
before I should receive the other Moiety of
the Reward: it was seven Months before I
could get them to fix <i>how many</i>, and then
they would neither agree to any Mode of
Trial proposed by me, nor propose any
themselves till <i>eleven Months</i> after that,
<i>viz.</i> not till the 11th Day of <i>April</i> last, when
(an Enquiry having been set on Foot in the
House of Commons) they were pleased
to propose, that instead of the Length of a
<i>West-India</i> Voyage, which is about <i>six Weeks</i>,
the Watches should be placed with their
very good Friend and Well-wisher Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i>
for <i>ten months</i>, and then be sent for
two months on board a Ship in the <i>Downs</i>;
and all this I am required to submit to,
without the least Shadow of Assurance on
their Part, that they will be satisfied with
this Trial, let it answer ever so well, or that
I shall thereby be brought at all the nearer
receiving what is due to me, altho’ (independent
of making the Watches) it must
necessarily employ one whole Year of mine
or my Son’s Time, in superintending an
Examination, which, after all, can only
prove that I, who have made one Machine,
can make another like it; and the Point of
general Practicability, about which so much
stir is <i>affected</i> to be made, would not be one
Jot advanced beyond what it is at present.</p>

<p>I cannot help begging the Reader will
here allow me to add a Remark or two upon
the general Practicability of my Invention,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_25" id="Page_25">[25]</a></span>as that is now said to be the only Thing
that was in Dispute between the Commissioners
and me, and that they only wanted
to be satisfied as to this Point. In order to
clear it up then, I will submit to the Public
to determine whether the general Use and
Practicability of my Invention can, in the
Nature of Things, be attacked, unless under
one of these three following Heads:</p>

<p>1. That a Time-keeper, however perfect,
is an insufficient Means of ascertaining the
Longitude at Sea.</p>

<p>2. That such Information has not been
given as will enable other Workmen to
make other Time-keepers of equal goodness
with that which is certified to have kept the
Longitude.</p>

<p>Or 3. That they will come to so enormous
a Price as to be out of the Reach of
Purchase.</p>

<p>From the Benefit of the first Objection
(even if it was founded in Truth, which I
utterly deny) the Commissioners have surely
precluded both themselves and the Nation,
as with Respect to me, by their repeated
Orders and Instructions, and after leading
me on for near Half a Century, to employ
my whole Time and make long Voyages for
<i>perfecting</i> the Invention, they can never be
permitted now to come and say <i>the Invention
itself</i> is good for nothing. Should any
one however continue to propagate such an
Opinion, I beg leave, in Contradiction to
it, to offer that of Sir <i>Isaac Newton</i>, and that
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_26" id="Page_26">[26]</a></span>of <i>Martin Folkes</i>, <i>Dr. Halley</i>, <i>Dr. Smith</i>, Mr.
<i>Graham</i>, and eight other Persons of great
Eminence, both publicly given to the House
of Commons and to be found in the Journals,
<i>viz.</i> Sir <i>Isaac</i>’s in Vol. 17, Page 677,
and the others in Vol. 29, Page 547.</p>

<p>The second Objection is flatly contradicted
by Evidence lately before the House of Commons,
by which it appears that the Description
and original Drawings from which the
Watch was made, as given in by me upon
Oath, are printed and published; and that Mr.
<i>Mudge</i> (the only one of the Watchmakers to
whom the Discovery was made, who has
been examined by the House of Commons)
declar’d he could make these Watches as
well as I can. Moreover I am ready, on
Condition of receiving the Remainder of
what’s due to me, upon Oath to give all
manner of future Information and Instruction
in my Power; and I hope it could never
enter into any Man’s Idea of general Practicability,
that I should actually teach every
indifferent Workman in the Nation, and
furnish each of them with a Set of Tools for
the Trial of his Ability, at my own Expence,
before I could be entitled to the Reward.</p>

<p>With Regard to the third Objection, no
Estimate of the future Expence can (from
the Nature of the Subject) be grounded upon
any Authority better than that of Opinion.
The Price of common Watches, where each
Part is made by a different Workman, bears
no Proportion to what must necessarily be
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_27" id="Page_27">[27]</a></span>charged by any Man who was to make the
whole with his own Hands: the same Reduction
will naturally take place when a Number
of Workmen are instructed to make the different
Parts of these. My Opinion is, that
they might in a very few Years be afforded
for about £.100 a-piece, and if a Reduction
of the Machinery can be effected (which I
am strongly inclined to think is the Case,
but have not had an Opportunity of proving
by Experiment for want of my Models) the
Expence may be reduced to about 70 or 80 l.</p>

<p>By this Time I think the Reader may naturally
exclaim, How can all these Things
be? What can induce a Number of Noblemen,
Statesmen and Officers of the first
Rank and most unblemished Characters; what
can induce the President of the Royal Society,
and the Professors of the Universities
(to each of whom his Majesty has been most
graciously pleased to order Payment of 15 l.
per Day for every Board of Longitude they
attend) and what can induce the Astronomer
Royal, thus to discourage an Invention which
they are specially constituted to improve,
protect, and support? I might answer with
Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i>, “that’s none of my Business
to account for.”&mdash;<i>The Facts are so</i>, and
this public Relation of them is extorted from
me, by a Conviction that no other Way is
left me to obtain Justice, or so likely to prevent
the Invention from perishing. However,
if it is expected of me, like Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i>,
to deliver an Opinion on this Point,
I shall declare what I believe <i>very sincerely</i>,
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_28" id="Page_28">[28]</a></span>that by far the greater Part of the Commissioners
are perfectly innocent of the Treatment
I have met with: most of them are
Commissioners by Virtue of great Employments
which engage their Time and Attention:
A Board so constituted is continually
changing; and this being a Matter of Science
which to many may seem rather abstruse,
it was very naturally left to the Management
of a few of those Members who
stand in the most immediate Relation to Science,
and whose Opinions, upon a Business
of this Nature, the rest of the Board had
too much Modesty to call in Question.
How well they have merited that Degree of
Confidence is left to the impartial World to
determine.</p>

<p>To return again to Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i>’s Account:
He, as I think has been already
shewn, having said and done every
Thing in his Power to the Dishonour and
Discouragement of my Invention, scruples
not to sum up his Opinion of it in the following
Terms:</p>

<p>“That Mr. <i>Harrison</i>’s Watch cannot be
depended upon to keep the Longitude
within a Degree, in a <i>West-India</i> Voyage
of six Weeks, nor to keep the Longitude
within Half a Degree for more than a
Fortnight, and then it must be kept in a
Place where the Thermometer is always
some Degrees above freezing: that, in
case the Cold amounts to freezing, the
Watch cannot be depended upon to keep
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_29" id="Page_29">[29]</a></span>the Longitude within Half a Degree for
more than a few Days, and perhaps not
so long, if the Cold be very intense:
nevertheless, that it is a useful and valuable
Invention, and in Conjunction with the
Observations of the Distance of the Moon
from the Sun and fixed Stars, may be
of considerable Advantage to Navigation.”</p>

<p>Having sufficiently refuted the first Part
of this Opinion already, it only remains for
me to make such Remarks on the Lunar
Method of finding the Longitude, as this
coupling of my Invention with it seems to
call upon me for.</p>

<p>It is with Reluctance that I follow Mr.
<i>Maskelyne</i> into a Subject in which I may
seem, like him, to be actuated by a selfish
Preference to my own Scheme; however, as
I shall give my Reasons for what I advance,
I will not hesitate to submit them to the Public.
I beg to be understood as a warm and
declared Friend to that and every other
Mode which can be devised of ascertaining
the Longitude at Sea, so long as they keep
within the Bounds of Reason and Probability.
Here are now two Methods before the Public;
Wou’d to God there were two Hundred!
The Importance of the Object would warrant
public Encouragement to them all;
but, called upon to say something on the
Subject, I think it incumbent upon me to
point out those Limits beyond which its
Utility cannot, from the Nature of the
Thing, be extended.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_30" id="Page_30">[30]</a></span>The Method of finding the Longitude by
the Moon, in which Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i> is in a
pecuniary way interested, is this.&mdash;If the
apparent Distance between the Sun and
Moon, or between the Moon and some
fix’d Star, at any certain Part of the Globe,
was for every Hour of the Year known; and
if a Navigator, when at Sea, could also, by
Observations, ascertain what is the apparent
Distance, at the Place where he is, between
the Sun and Moon, or between the Moon
and a Star, and likewise their respective
Altitudes; and if he could also, at the same
Moment, ascertain the Time of the Day,
either by an immediate Observation of the
Sun, or by a Watch which would keep
Time pretty exactly from the last solar Observation;
these Matters of Fact being
given, the Difference of Longitude may
from thence be calculated. I admit the
Principle to be absolutely true in Theory.
The Lunar Tables, for which the Rewards
have been given, are calculated to shew the
Distance between the Sun and Moon, or
Moon and Stars, at <i>Greenwich</i>; I admit the
Practicability of making such Tables; but
with Regard to the other Requisites, I beg
Leave to observe that, for six Days in every
Month, the Moon is too near the Sun for
observing, consequently, during those Days,
the Method falls <i>totally</i> to the Ground; that
for about other thirteen Days in every
Month, the Sun and Moon are at too great
a Distance for observing them at the same
Time, or are not at the same Time visible;
therefore, during those 13 Days, we must depend
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_31" id="Page_31">[31]</a></span>upon Observations of the Moon and
Stars, and upon a Watch to keep Time,
from the last Solar Observation with sufficient
Exactness, which common Watches
cannot be depended upon to do; well therefore
might Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i> admit that my
Invention would become of considerable
Value, even if taken in Aid of the Lunar
Tables. I leave the Reader to judge of the
Practicability of making these Observations
from what follows:</p>

<p>To ascertain the Longitude by the Moon
and a Star, requires a distinct Horizon to be
seen in the Night, which is next to impossible,
and if you have not an Horizon, the
Altitude of neither Moon nor Star can be
taken: It also requires (and this perhaps
when a Ship is in a high Sea) the Distance
of the Moon and Star, in order to come at
which, the Image of one of them must be
reflected through a silvered Glass, and the
other seen through an unsilvered Part of the
same Glass; and they must be brought into
Conjunction in the Line that connects the
silvered and unsilvered Parts, and this to an
Exactness only true in Theory, for an Error
of a Minute of a Degree committed in this
Observation, will mislead the Mariner Half
a Degree in his Longitude; Now I call upon
any Astronomers of Reputation publickly
to declare, that they have, even at Land,
and with the best Instruments <i>Europe</i> affords,
been able to make this Observation of the
Moon and a Star with <i>any thing like</i> the Precision
required to determine the Longitude
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_32" id="Page_32">[32]</a></span>within the Limits required by the Act of the
12th of Queen <i>Anne</i>; I know it cannot be
done. Nay I further call upon any such
Astronomers to declare, whether even in Observations
of the Distance between the Sun
and Moon, two of them observing together
have <i>generally speaking</i> agreed in this Observation
within a Minute of a Degree: I know
that in general the Difference between the
best Observers even at Land will be more,
and as a farther Proof of this Assertion, I
refer the Reader to the Note below:<a name="FNanchor_6_6" id="FNanchor_6_6"></a><a href="#Footnote_6_6" class="fnanchor">[6]</a> And
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_33" id="Page_33">[33]</a></span>if these Matters of Fact are still doubted, I
shall beg Leave to call upon Mr. <i>Maskelyne</i>
and Mr. <i>Green</i> to declare how near they,
with Admiral <i>Tyrrel</i> agreed in determining
the Longitude by the Sun and Moon in their
Voyage to <i>Barbadoes</i>; and also whether during
that Voyage they ever did determine
their Longitude by the Moon and Stars.&mdash;I
know they did not, for they found the
Observation too difficult, and indeed <i>it is
only true in Theory</i>.</p>

<p>From the foregoing Premises I infer,</p>

<p>1st. That during six Days in every
Month, no Observations can be made by
this Method to ascertain the Longitude at
Sea.</p>

<p>2dly, That during 13 other Days in each
Month, it is impracticable to ascertain it by
this Method with any Instruments hitherto
contrived, or which the Nature of the Service
to be performed seems to admit of</p>

<p>And 3dly, That during the remaining 11
Days in each Month, when the Sun and
Moon may, if the Weather is clear be observed
at the same Time, no Reliance can
safely be placed upon the best Instruments
in the Hand of the best Observer for ascertaining
the Longitude within the Limits of
<span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_34" id="Page_34">[34]</a></span>the Act of Queen <i>Anne</i>; and consequently,
that how valuable soever the Lunar Tables
may be for correcting a long dead Reckoning,
and thereby telling us <i>whereabouts</i> we
are, when we are not afraid of falling in with
the Land, yet even during these 11 Days,
they do not extend to the Security of Ships
near the Shore.</p>

<p>This <i>Method</i> of ascertaining the Longitude
by the Moon has already cost the Publick
the Sum of 6,600<i>l.</i> at least, and yet no
proper Experiment has been made of it.</p>

<p>I shall not presume to make any Reflections
on the different Treatment the two Inventions
have met with, nor will I take up
more of the Reader’s Time by a Detail of
the very earnest Attention paid by the <i>French</i>
Government to this Object. If our Rivals
in Commerce and Arts <i>should</i> rob us of the
Honour as well as the first Advantages of the
Discovery, I hope it will be admitted that
the Fault is not mine: And I likewise flatter
myself that I have now furnished sufficient
Materials for the Justification of my
Friends, and for shewing that the Cause which
they from publick spirited Motives had the
Goodness to espouse, was not unworthy of
their Patronage.</p>

Objection that was raised by two of the Commissioners,
both famous for their Knowledge in Astronomy;
<i>viz.</i> That the Observations of equal Altitudes made at
<i>Portsmouth</i>, could not be depended on, because the equal
Altitude Instrument had been removed from the Place
of Observation in the Morning, to another Place to
make the Afternoon Observations; from which it is
plain that these great Astronomers did not understand
either the Principles or Use of one of the most simple Instruments
in Astronomy.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_4_4" id="Footnote_4_4"></a><a href="#FNanchor_4_4"><span class="label">[4]</span></a> If this Interpretation of the Act was true, and the
Commissioners had a general discretionary Power, where
was the Reason or Use of specifying <i>any Trial at all</i> in
the original Act?</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_5_5" id="Footnote_5_5"></a><a href="#FNanchor_5_5"><span class="label">[5]</span></a> The Board contracted with Mr. <i>Kendall</i> (one of the
six Persons to whom the Discovery was made) to make
a Watch after the Model of mine. He was to be paid
for every Thing before-hand, and to begin in a
Twelvemonth after making the Bargain; he is to
make Parts like Parts, but is not to be answerable for
his Watch’s going at all. My Timekeeper is now in his
Possession, tho’ he is not yet ready to make Use of it;
There are some Parts in the making of which the Model
can be of little or no Use to him; I only desired it for
six or eight Months, and am confident he can have no
Occasion for it before that Time is expired: however
I have offered to have it forth coming whenever Mr.
<i>Kendall</i> declares that he wants it, therefore I apprehend
their Engagements with Mr. <i>Kendall</i> afford no solid
Reason for the Commissioners to refuse lending it to me.</p></div>

<div class="footnote"><p><a name="Footnote_6_6" id="Footnote_6_6"></a><a href="#FNanchor_6_6"><span class="label">[6]</span></a> In the fifth Volume of M. <span class="smcap">De La Caille</span>’s
Ephemerides, Page 31, he says, “that any Person
would be in the wrong to suppose that the Longitude
at Sea can be determined by the Moon, to a
less Error than two Degrees, let the Method
which is employed be never so perfect, let the Instruments,
of the Sort now in use, be never so excellent,
and let the Observer be the most able and
accomplished. For if we examine, without prejudice,
all the Circumstances which enter into the Calculation
and into the Observation of a Longitude at
Sea, we shall be easily convinced, that it would be
ridiculous to maintain, that the Sum of the inevitable
Errors should not amount to five Minutes of a
Degree, that is, to two Degrees and a half of Longitude.”
<i>N. B.</i> M. <span class="smcap">de la Caille</span> published this
in the Year 1755, and is universally allowed to
have been an excellent Observer, and made several

<p>Dr. <span class="smcap">Halley</span> and Dr. <span class="smcap">Bevis</span> (as appeared to the

Quadrant, rectified by Mr. <span class="smcap">Hadley</span> himself,
and in his presence, attempt to take the angular
Distance of the Moon from <span class="smcap">Aldebaran</span>, a
Star of the first Magnitude; but with such bad
Success (some of the Observations removing <span class="smcap">Greenwich</span>
from itself almost as far as <span class="smcap">Paris</span>) that Dr.
<span class="smcap">Halley</span> seemed to be out of Hope of obtaining

Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a
computer virus, or computer codes that damage or cannot be read by
your equipment.

1.F.2.  LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees.  YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH F3.  YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3.  LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from.  If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium with
your written explanation.  The person or entity that provided you with
the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in lieu of a
refund.  If you received the work electronically, the person or entity
providing it to you may choose to give you a second opportunity to
receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund.  If the second copy
is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing without further
opportunities to fix the problem.

harmless from all liability, costs and expenses, including legal fees,
that arise directly or indirectly from any of the following which you do
or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this or any Project Gutenberg-tm
work, (b) alteration, modification, or additions or deletions to any
Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any Defect you cause.


Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4
and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.
To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
